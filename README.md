# chrome-dino-arduino-lcd
Google Chrome's dinosaur game on a 16x2 LCD with individual pixel movement.
Extends the LiquidCrystal class to allow individual pixel toggling over a 40x8 canvas in the upper left corner of the LCD screen.
It uses all the allowed custom characters and changes their bitmaps dynamically for them to match an internal buffer.
